      We've Learnt how to create react app by using the ulitility like create-react-app and also we've seen how to use bundlers like : vite. It was really greate to learn all this! Also we read package.json files of both the folders : 01basicreact and 01basicvite and also we remove extra files from the src folder from both 01basicreact and 01basicvite and then executed self written code!
